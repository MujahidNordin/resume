   <h2>Hi, </h2>
   <p>I'm Mujahid Nordin, a Web Developer and Computer Science Student.

    This site was created during a web development bootcamp by Angela Yu from scratch, using only HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a digital Nomad traveling to 14 countries in Asia and Oceania.</p>

<p>I have a big dream to build a website or an app for the community's welfare by starting with programmer. This dream has been with me since I graduated from college. I want to contribute to society by creating new job opportunities through this way.</p>

<p>You can also support me by purchasing my travel ebook and please pray for me so that my dreams come true.</p>
